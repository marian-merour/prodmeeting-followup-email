Hi {{ artist_first_name }},

It was great chatting with you today and discussing the vision for your course on {{ course_subject }}. Very excited about this topic! I am sure our community will love it too.

As promised, here are the links to the documents and folders we reviewed in the meeting for easy reference.

**Course folder:** Here is where all the video, audio, and other course material can be uploaded to:
> <{{ artist_edit_link }}>

**Course outline:** Where you can plan the course structure, goals, and lesson plan.
> <{{ course_outline_link }}>

**References from other instructors:** Helpful for inspiration in filming and planning
> <{{ references_link }}>

**Technical Guidelines and Deliverables**
> <{{ tech_guidelines_link }}>

**Next steps in Pre-Production:**
{% if outline_delivery_date %}- **{{ outline_delivery_date }}** - Course outline doc to be completed
{% endif %}{% if demo_video_date %}- **{{ demo_video_date }}** - Demo videos submitted for every shot
{% endif %}{% if artist_bio_date %}- **{{ artist_bio_date }}** - Send artist bio material
{% endif %}{% if course_delivery_date %}- **{{ course_delivery_date }}** - Delivery of all course lessons + resources/homework/exercise material
{% endif %}{% if promo_trailer_date %}- **{{ promo_trailer_date }}** - Promotional trailer footage
{% endif %}{% if contract_timeline %}- **{{ contract_timeline }}** - Contract timeline
{% endif %}{% if checkin_schedule %}- **{{ checkin_schedule }}** - Check-ins
{% endif %}- **Mondays** (weekly) - Marian will check in by email to get status/progress updates.

Hope this all makes sense and is clear. Let me know if there is anything I missed or if you have any questions!

Looking forward to working together on this course.

Cheers,

Marian
